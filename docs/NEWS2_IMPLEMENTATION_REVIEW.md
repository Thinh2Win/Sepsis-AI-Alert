   - Reduces FHIR API calls by ~85%
   - Maintains performance while adding comprehensive assessment

3. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Seamless integration with current sepsis scoring endpoints

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Components Created

| Component | File Location | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **NEWS2 Models** | `app/models/news2.py` | Complete Pydantic data models for NEWS2 parameters and results |
| **NEWS2 Constants** | `app/core/news2_constants.py` | Clinical thresholds, LOINC mappings, and configuration |
| **NEWS2 Scoring Logic** | `app/utils/news2_scoring.py` | Core scoring algorithms with data reuse optimization |

| **Enhanced Response Builder** | `app/services/sepsis_response_builder.py` | Updated to handle triple scoring system responses |

#### Key Technical Features

1. **Parameter Reuse Implementation**
   ```python
   @classmethod
   def from_existing_parameters(cls, patient_id: str, 
                               sofa_params: Optional[Any] = None, 
                               qsofa_params: Optional[Any] = None, 
                               timestamp: Optional[datetime] = None) -> "News2Parameters":
       # Optimized data reuse logic
   ```

2. **Fallback Mechanism**
   - Clinical default values for missing parameters
   - Robust error handling with graceful degradation
   - Data quality tracking and reliability scoring

3. **Combined Risk Assessment**
   - MINIMAL → LOW → MODERATE → HIGH → CRITICAL risk levels
   - Takes highest risk level among all three scoring systems
   - Priority given to sepsis (qSOFA ≥2) and deterioration (NEWS2 ≥7) indicators

### Clinical Response Thresholds

- **MEDIUM Risk (5-6 points):** Urgent clinical review within 1 hour
- **HIGH Risk (≥7 points):** Emergency assessment and continuous monitoring

## Performance Optimizations

### Data Reuse Efficiency

**Parameter Overlap Analysis:**
- NEWS2 total parameters: 7
- Shared with SOFA/qSOFA: 6 parameters (85.7%)
- New parameter required: 1 (supplemental oxygen only)

**API Call Reduction:**
- Without optimization: 21 FHIR API calls (7 per scoring system)
- With optimization: ~3-4 FHIR API calls (shared data + supplemental oxygen)
- **Performance improvement: ~85% reduction in API calls**

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Intelligent Parameter Sharing**
   - Respiratory rate (shared across all three systems)
   - Systolic blood pressure (shared between qSOFA and NEWS2)
   - Heart rate (shared between SOFA and NEWS2)
   - Temperature (shared between SOFA and NEWS2)
   - Oxygen saturation (shared between SOFA and NEWS2)
   - Glasgow Coma Score (shared across all three systems)

2. **Fallback Data Collection**
   - Only fetch missing parameters individually
   - Graceful degradation when data unavailable
   - Clinical default values ensure scoring always possible

## Integration Points

### API Endpoints Enhanced

   - `GET /patients/{patient_id}/sepsis-score`
   - Now returns SOFA, qSOFA, and NEWS2 scores by default
   - Scoring systems selectable via `scoring_systems` parameter
   - Combined risk assessment with clinical recommendations

2. **Batch Patient Scoring**
   - `POST /patients/batch-sepsis-scores`
   - Triple scoring system support for population monitoring
   - High-risk patient identification across all systems
   - Performance-optimized for dashboard integration

### Response Schema Updates
